# Financial-Habits-Analysis-for-Loan-Prediction
### Abstract:

This study aims to analyze the impact of financial habits on loan prediction. By examining various financial behaviors and patterns, we seek to identify key factors that can predict an individual's creditworthiness. The analysis is based on a diverse dataset comprising financial records, credit histories, and borrower information. Employing machine learning techniques, this research can assist lenders in making more informed decisions while extending credit to potential borrowers.
